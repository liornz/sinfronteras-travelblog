Bagan, the former capital of several kingdoms of Burma, is world-renowned for its temples. It is located on the arid plateau of the country, next to the banks of the Irrawaddy River. Bagan was the former capital of the Pagan empire. The Mons were the first settlers. Burmese migrations subsequently arrived. But the time of greatest splendor of Myanmar (Burma) was not until the 11th to 14th centuries with King Anawrahta. During this period, nearly 4,000 temples and stupas were built. It is truly unique in the world and is completely worth visiting. Not only for its temples, but also for its people.
