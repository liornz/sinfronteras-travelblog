Bangkok is an amazing city, the capital of Thailand that mixes tradition with modernity. In Thai Bangkok means "The City of Angels" and is undoubtedly one of the best capitals of Southeast Asia. There's plenty to see in Bangkok, whether it's sightseeing with temples and palaces, shopping or seeing its markets, strolling through its parks, climbing a multitude of transport whether by land or water, or eating at Bangkok's street stalls. It is also one of the most important points for backpackers and starting point for many people who either enter Southeast Asia for the first time or spend a few days in Bangkok before flying to another of the wonderful countries of Asia.
