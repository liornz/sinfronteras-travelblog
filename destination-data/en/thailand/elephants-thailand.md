Thailand, being the natural habitat of the elephant, has a culture closely linked to this animal, because apart from being part of the mythology and legends of the country, the elephant was used for many years for all kinds of physical work. In recent decades and due to the process of industrialization and loss of its natural habitat in the country, the use of the elephant gradually drifted towards tourism being currently one of the most important claims that Thailand has. As the subject is complicated, I leave you this video that will help you know where to see elephants in Thailand and recognize where you should not go or where you should try to go to enjoy an incredible day in contact with these fabulous animals and not contribute to any type of abuse animal.
