The Red Lotus Sea is a natural wonder found in the northeast of Udon Thani Province. Located about 50 km from the city this immense freshwater lagoon offers one of the most magical prints that can be contemplated, the flowering of millions of lotus flowers that sift the water as if it were a natural carpet, with colors ranging from deep red to pink giving it that symbolism so typical of Buddhism that considers the lotus flower as the flower of the resurrection for its ease of emerging from the waters.
